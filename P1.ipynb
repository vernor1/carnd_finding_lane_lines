You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",

You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "[YM] Challenge accepted! The current pipeline is using linear reggession to interpolate the points of detected line segments to two lane lines - left and right. I think that a better solution should interpolate the detected points with a cubic spline. Besides the road curves, the most challenging part of the problem was the concrete bridge in challenge.mp4. The pipeline is bleaching the yellow median line on the bridge in order to improve the line gradient. However the pipeline doesn't handle well the black rubber marks on the light bridge surface, while the edges of the marks have a higher gradient than the yellow median line, so they are falsely detected as lane lines. I'm not yet sure how to solve the problem, perhaps by discarding line segments located far from the regions where most of the line segments are detected or where the lines have been detected in previous frames."
